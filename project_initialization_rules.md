## Enhanced Project Management & Tracking Rules

### Pre-Implementation Phase
1. **Always read project documentation first:**
   - Review requirements.md for project specifications and constraints
   - Check design.md for architecture decisions and design patterns
   - Examine tasks.md for current task status and dependencies

2. **Validate understanding:**
   - Ensure clear understanding of user stories and acceptance criteria
   - Verify alignment with architectural decisions
   - Identify task dependencies and prerequisites

### Implementation Phase
1. **Update task tracking:**
   - Mark task status as "üü° In Progress" 
   - Add timestamp and detailed status updates
   - Document any blockers or dependencies discovered

2. **Follow established patterns:**
   - Ensure new code aligns with existing architecture
   - Follow established naming conventions and patterns
   - Respect design decisions documented in design.md

### Post-Implementation Phase
1. **Complete task documentation:**
   - Mark completed tasks as "‚úÖ Done" with completion timestamp
   - Add new tasks discovered during implementation
   - Update task status and progress overview

2. **Update project documentation:**
   - Document any changes to original requirements or design
   - Update design.md when making architectural changes
   - Add new requirements to requirements.md if scope changes

## Code Generation Standards

### Quality Requirements
- Always write clean, readable code with meaningful variable names
- Include comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
- Add inline comments explaining complex logic and business rules
- Follow language-specific conventions and style guides
- Generate unit tests for all new functions and methods
- Never hardcode sensitive data (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- Verify code meets requirements specified in project documentation

### Documentation Standards
- Generate clear README sections for new features
- Include usage examples and code samples
- Document API endpoints with parameters and responses
- Explain configuration options and environment variables
- Update inline documentation when modifying existing code
- Keep project docs synchronized with implementation changes

### Testing Requirements
- Create unit tests using appropriate testing frameworks
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Include edge cases (null, empty, boundary values)
- Generate integration tests for API endpoints
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Mock external dependencies in tests
- Verify tests cover requirements outlined in project documentation

## Security Requirements

- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization checks
- Avoid deprecated or insecure libraries and methods
- Include HTTPS and secure configuration by default
- Log security events appropriately
- Cross-reference security requirements from requirements.md

## Error Handling Standards

- Always include appropriate error handling for operations that might fail
- Provide meaningful error messages for debugging
- Log errors with sufficient context
- Don't suppress errors without explicit justification
- Use language-specific error handling patterns
- Handle edge cases identified in requirements documentation

## Performance Guidelines

- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms
- Consider memory usage and resource management
- Avoid premature optimization
- Profile before making performance changes
- Use async/await patterns where appropriate
- Meet performance requirements specified in project docs

## Task Management Workflow

### Implementation Lifecycle
1. **Pre-Implementation:**
   - Read and understand current task from tasks.md
   - Review related requirements in requirements.md
   - Check design constraints in design.md
   - Identify dependencies and prerequisites

2. **During Implementation:**
   - Update task status to "üü° In Progress"
   - Follow established coding standards
   - Implement according to design specifications
   - Write tests that verify requirements

3. **Post-Implementation:**
   - Update task status to "‚úÖ Done" with completion timestamp
   - Document any deviations from original plan
   - Add new tasks if additional work is discovered
   - Update relevant documentation files

## Response Format Protocol

### Structure Requirements
1. **Start with context:** Reference relevant requirements and design decisions
2. **Explain reasoning:** Provide architectural decision rationale
3. **Offer alternatives:** Provide multiple approaches when alternatives exist
4. **Implementation guidance:** Include step-by-step implementation guidance
5. **Risk assessment:** Highlight potential gotchas or edge cases
6. **Tool recommendations:** Suggest relevant tools or libraries when helpful
7. **Task updates:** Specify what tasks were completed and what's next

### Language-Specific Standards
- **Python:** Follow PEP 8, use type hints, include docstrings
- **JavaScript/TypeScript:** Use ESLint rules, prefer const/let, include types
- **Java:** Follow Java conventions, use proper exception handling
- **C#:** Follow Microsoft conventions, use proper disposal patterns
- **Go:** Follow Go conventions, handle errors explicitly

## Quality Assurance Checklist

- Don't proceed without understanding project context from documentation files

## Communication Protocol

- Always explain what you're implementing

- Identify what tasks are being updated
- Highlight any risks or concerns
- Suggest next steps for project progression
- Maintain professional and helpful tone
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Reference documentation appropriately
